    # TODO: Implement BFS shortest path using Mojo
    # 
    # Key considerations:
    # - Use Mojo's memory management for visited array
    # - Implement queue data structure
    # - Grid access: grid[row * cols + col]  
    # - Directions: [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]
    # - Handle edge cases (same start/end, no path)
    
    # Placeholder implementation
    result.store(0, -1)  # Return -1 as placeholder
