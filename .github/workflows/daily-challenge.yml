            Read CLAUDE.md and follow the Creation Workflow to create a new LeetGPU coding challenge that doesn't duplicate any existing challenge, then open a PR.

            IMPORTANT: We already have too many easy element-wise challenges. Follow these rules when picking difficulty:
            - Do NOT create easy challenges unless the topic truly warrants it. We have plenty.
            - Strongly prefer medium or hard difficulty.
            - Pick topics that require interesting GPU techniques: shared memory tiling, warp-level primitives, cooperative groups, multi-pass algorithms, graph algorithms, signal processing, scientific computing, or ML training kernels.
            - Good medium examples: parallel scan variants, image processing (morphological ops, bilateral filter), sparse operations, tree/graph traversals, numerical methods (conjugate gradient, LU decomposition), quantization schemes.
            - Good hard examples: GPU merge sort, parallel hash tables, breadth-first search on large graphs, flash attention variants, tensor contraction, parallel Huffman coding, N-body simulation.

            List existing challenges first (ls challenges/*/), then pick something genuinely different.
